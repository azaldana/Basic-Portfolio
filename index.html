    <p>A Sacramento native, I graduated from California State University, Sacramento with a Bachelorâ€™s in Graphic Design. Shortly after graduation I moved to San Diego to pursue my career in design. Mixed with a love of typography, I enjoy making ideas come to reality with my designs.</p>
    <p>My designs are innovative, always maintaining the brand consistency and style. With a design style of modern, clean and organized, I make sure every piece of my creative puzzle connects and has a greater purpose.</p>
    <p>My website is a testament to that style. Featured are some of the projects I have done during my professional career in both Sacramento and San Diego. </p>
